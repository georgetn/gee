Introduction
------------

gee is a percentage-based grid system defaulting to 12 columns. It can be either
used in a semantic way by using LESS mixins or in a traditional class-based
(unsemantic) way.

The basic components are "rows" and "columns" where a row contains one or more
columns. The only requirement is that all columns are children of a row.
