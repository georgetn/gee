Introduction
------------

gee is a percentage-based grid system defaulting to 12 columns. It can be either
used in a semantic way by using LESS mixins or in a traditional class-based
(unsemantic) way.

The basic components are "grids" and "units" where a grids contains one or more
units. The only requirement is that all units are children of a grid.
